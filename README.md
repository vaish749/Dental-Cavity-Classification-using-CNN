# Dental-Cavity-Classification-using-CNN
Dental Cavity Classification using Convolutional Neural Network


This project aims to develop a dental cavity detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze both color and x-ray images. Most existing projects deal with the detection of dental cavities in x-ray images only. The proposed system will first preprocess the images to augment the dataset to create more image samples. Then, the CNN model will be trained using a large dataset of annotated dental images to learn the features of dental cavities. The trained model will be able to accurately detect cavities in both color and x-ray images. The model for color images gives an accuracy of 95% and the model for xray images gives an accuracy of average 83%. The system will be evaluated on a test set of dental images and give prediction for cavity detection. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide dentists and healthcare professionals with a reliable tool to assist in early detection of dental cavities, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment costs.
